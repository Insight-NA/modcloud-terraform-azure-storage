## Azure Table Storage
Azure Table storage is a service that stores non-relational structured data (also known as structured NoSQL data) in the cloud, providing a key/attribute store with a schemaless design. Because Table storage is schemaless, it's easy to adapt your data as the needs of your application evolve. Access to Table storage data is fast and cost-effective for many types of applications, and is typically lower in cost than traditional SQL for similar volumes of data. To learn more about Azure table storage, please refere to [azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/tables/table-storage-overview).

## Access Policy Start and Expiry Timestamp

For the Access Policy start and expiry attributes, enter either a date (YYYY-MM-DD) or date/time (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS) format for your timezone. The utc_offset helps convert the enter timestamps to UTC, which the AzureRM API expects. For instance, Eastern timezone (East US 2) has a UTC offset of -5 hours, for Central (Central US / South Central US) -6, and for Greenwich timezone (UK West) 0.


## Azure Storage Redundency

To check the requirements for storage account skus or types of redundency please refer to the [azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json#summary-of-redundancy-options).  

Some skus or redundency types are not available in all regions.
